Working as a head of department in large companies (over 9 years) and co-owners of an online store (over 6 years), I gained practical experience and knowledge in: personnel management, planning and budgeting, profit and loss account, business process development, online store operation. 
My strengths include: an analytical mind, a sense of tact, interest in new things and the ability to listen and hear others. 
I'm not afraid to start all over again at this stage of my life. I am ready to study hard to gain new experience and knowledge.I want to get not only a promising job, but also enter a completely different world. This is the IT World!
